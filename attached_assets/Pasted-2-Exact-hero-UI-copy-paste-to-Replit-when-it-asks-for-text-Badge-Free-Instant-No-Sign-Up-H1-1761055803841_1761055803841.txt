Q: What WCAG levels are supported?
A: AA and AAA for Small and Large text. Thresholds: AA Small 4.5:1, AA Large 3.0:1, AAA Small 7.0:1, AAA Large 4.5:1.

Q: Can I export my favorite pairs?
A: Yes. Star any passing pair and export all favorites as a PNG image or a PDF for quick sharing with your team or clients.

Q: Does this work for logos, buttons, and UI?
A: Yes. The preview line simulates body text or larger UI elements. Use “Large” mode for headings, buttons, or logos on brand backgrounds.

Q: Is the tool free and private?
A: Yes—free, instant, and no sign-up. Processing happens in your browser for speed and privacy.

5) Section copy (education blocks)
What Is a Color Palette Tester?
A color palette tester lets you evaluate the readability and accessibility of your brand colors. Instead of checking one combination at a time, this tool tests every foreground/background pairing in one click and flags which ones pass WCAG guidelines.

Why Test Color Contrast?
• Improve readability across web, app, and print
• Meet accessibility standards (WCAG) with confidence
• Speed up reviews by seeing all pass/fail results at once
• Share decisions easily with PNG/PDF exports
• Keep brand colors consistent across light/dark backgrounds

WCAG Levels Explained
WCAG defines minimum contrast ratios for legibility:
- AA Small Text: 4.5:1
- AA Large Text (≥18pt or ≥14pt bold): 3.0:1
- AAA Small Text: 7.0:1
- AAA Large Text: 4.5:1
Use Small for paragraphs and body text. Use Large for headers, buttons, logos, and large UI labels.

Supported Color Inputs
Paste colors as:
- HEX (#RRGGBB)
- RGB (rgb(255, 111, 97))
- HSL (hsl(5, 100%, 69%))
Enter one color per line or separate by commas.

6) Ad experience prompt (so Replit lays them out tastefully)
Add three tasteful ad placeholders with fixed heights to avoid layout shift:
- Top: below the hero controls (100px tall)
- Mid: between the results grid and the CTA card (100px tall)
- Footer: above the site footer (100px tall)

Style: light dashed border, rounded corners, subtle text like “Ad space — coming soon”. Reserve space even when ads aren’t loaded. Keep at least 24px vertical spacing from other elements.

7) Visual style prompt (to match the Converter)
Use Inter font, generous white space, max content width 960–1200px, soft shadows, 12–14px corner radii, and muted gray borders. Primary buttons are near-black with white text; secondary are white with 1px gray border. Use a gentle animated rainbow gradient ONLY on the words “Color Palette” in the H1 and respect prefers-reduced-motion. Cards should have clear hierarchy, bold titles, and accessible color badges (green for Pass, red for Fail).

8) Footer & cross-linking prompt
Footer includes:
- “Made with ❤️ by The Color Palette Studio” (external link, opens new tab)
- Links: Privacy · Terms · Contact
- Small secondary nav: “Explore more free tools → Color Code Converter · Contrast Checker · Harmony Generator”
Ensure links are crawlable text (not images).

9) Compliance + pages prompt
Generate simple pages at /privacy-policy, /terms, and /contact using clean headings and plain text. The Privacy page must mention Google Analytics and Google AdSense cookies with opt-out links. Terms should include “as is” warranty disclaimer, acceptable use, and third-party services clause. Contact can be a mailto link to support@thecolorpalettestudio.com. Also create /robots.txt and /sitemap.xml and link the sitemap in robots.txt.

10) Launch checklist prompt (so Replit prepares for deploy)
Prepare for Vercel:
- Provide a build suitable for Vite static hosting (dist folder).
- Include a vercel.json pointing to the output directory.
- Use semantic headings (H1, H2), meta tags, OG/Twitter tags, and a canonical link.
- Minimize CLS by reserving ad slot heights.
- Provide copy and labels exactly as specified above.
